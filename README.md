# Python exercises

These are Python exercises done by me on a course called [Programming for Linguists](https://studies.helsinki.fi/opintotarjonta/cu/hy-CU-117878680-2021-08-01/KIK-LG208/Ohjelmointia_lingvisteille) which focuses less on mathematical calculations and more on string and text processing. The exercises are developed mostly using [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). I am using [pytest](https://pytest.org) as a unit testing framework.

## How to run?

You can run the snippets and tests from the root folder.

To run a single programs:

```
python src/assignment_0_1.py
```

To run the tests:

```
pytest tests/test_input.py
```
